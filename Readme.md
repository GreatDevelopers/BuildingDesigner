===========
Overview :-
===========
This project is used to draw 3D models of skeletons of buildings of various dimensions.
It is directly aimed at civil engineers and uses Layman words for easy understanding.
Since it just requires some basic inputs, it eases the task of designing buildings.
With the building design output, it can also serve with FEM analysis done on the building. It serves with a stad pro input file and a FElt input file.

===============
Requirements :-
===============

1) LAMP server
2) BRL-CAD ( for 3D building images )
3) FElt element analysis ( for analysis of building )

========
Usage :-
========

1) Just copy all the files into your public_html or www folder.
2) Change folder permissions to 777
3) Change paths of mged ( for BRL-CAD ) and felt accodringly ( Now on default paths ) in shell file
4) Access it through browser
